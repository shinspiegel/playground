This is a vanilla JS project just to play on the basics again.

**Want to try this in your machine?**

Just make sure that you have:

- `git` installed
- `node` and `npm` installed

If you have, you can:

1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/shinspiegel/binary-to-decimal-webapp.git`)
1. Enter the folder (`cd binary-to-decimal-webapp`)
1. Start the project (`npx serve`)

Do this in your terminal (could it be in the integrated terminal of your VSCode), and you can open a browser on the `localhost:5000`.

Thanks for seeing this project.
