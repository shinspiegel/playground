# The Base Rule (D20)

- The GM will determine the target number (TN)
- Determine your bonus
  - Item bonus (pick the higher)
  - Feature bonus (pick the higher)
  - Untyped (unnamed), sum all and apply
- Roll d20
  - It's a 1? You just got a -10 on your roll
  - It's a 20? You just got a +10 on your roll
- Sum the die + your bonus
  - It's greater than TN? Success!
    - Did you got over 10 from the TN? Critical success!
  - It's lower than TN? Failure!
    - Did you got below 10 from the TN? Critical failure!
