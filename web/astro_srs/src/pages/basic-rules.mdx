This section outlines some basic terminology needed to understand the rest of the rules.

# Basics Rules and Principles to follow

The game rules chapter provides a detailed explanation of how to play the game. This section will cover the basics of game mechanics, as well as some of the more advanced systems.

## Fractions

Whenever division or a similar operation is called for and the result contains a fraction, round down to the whole number portion of the result.

<ExampleBox>

Any calculation that requires to divide a number should drop any fractions. For example if you need to split the 12
experience points among 5 players, this will result in 2 experience points per player (12 ÷ 5 = 2.4)

</ExampleBox>

## Reading the Dice

Whenever the results of a character's actions are in question or a random number is needed, regular 6-sided dice are used to determine the result. There are two ways to read dice:

**XD6**: Roll X dice together, check the value market of each die, sum this values, this is the total.

<ExampleBox>

**1D6**: Roll 1 die, check the value market on the die, this is the total.

**2D6**: Roll 2 dice together, check the value market of each die, sum this values, this is the total.

**3D6**: Roll 3 dice together, check the value market of each die, sum this values, this is the total.

</ExampleBox>

Most of the cases you will need 2d6, but you could need to use more if the rules specified this need.

**D66** – Roll two dice. The smaller number will be considered the 10s, and the greater dice will be considered the 1s, sum the result.

<ExampleBox>

For example, if you roll **2** and **5**, this will be considered **25** (2 x 10 + 5).

If you roll **4** and **1**, this will be **14** (1 x 10 + 4). This values will be used in some specific tables for selecting random values.

Because of the nature of this type of roll, the only possible results will be:

| Dice | Result |     | Dice | Result |
| :--: | :----: | --- | :--: | :----: |
| 1, 1 |   11   |     | 3, 3 |   33   |
| 1, 2 |   12   |     | 3, 4 |   34   |
| 1, 3 |   13   |     | 3, 5 |   35   |
| 1, 4 |   14   |     | 3, 6 |   36   |
| 1, 5 |   15   |     | 4, 4 |   44   |
| 1, 6 |   16   |     | 4, 5 |   45   |
| 2, 2 |   22   |     | 4, 6 |   46   |
| 2, 3 |   23   |     | 5, 5 |   55   |
| 2, 4 |   24   |     | 5, 6 |   56   |
| 2, 5 |   25   |     | 6, 6 |   56   |
| 2, 6 |   26   |     |      |        |

## The RoC Principle

When you need to choose an item from a list or chart, the RoC principle (an abbreviation for "Roll or Choose") states that you can roll dice to choose, or just pick an item yourself. It's also okay to roll the dice first, then decide you don't want that result and choose another. Some charts have values outside the range of the dice (for example, a "0" entry) which can only be chosen on purpose by invoking this principle.

## Writing Convention

Occasionally the rules will use certain symbols and typefaces to clearly differentiate certain game-mechanical terms with their concrete values in play.

**[square brackets]** – A mathematical formula or value. For example, [level + 1] or [Strength].

**[Atribute Name]** vs **[SHORT]** - Any time that you see an attribute name in his fully name, this means to use the _value_, if you see the short three letter, that means to use the _modifier_. You can find more information on the [character](/characters#value-and-modifier)

# Glossary

**Player**: A participant in the game. Usually each player controls a single PC when playing a session.

**GM**: An abbreviation for Game Master. This player hosts the game and is responsible for the direction of the Scenario, the bookkeeping, and the arbitration of the rules.

**NPC**: An abbreviation for Non-Player Character. This refers to any character controlled by the GM and no other player.

**PC**: An abbreviation for Player Character. This refers to a character controlled by a player other than the GM. Generally each player will have a single PC to control.

**Level**: A numerical abstraction representing a character's overall power. A higher level means a more powerful character.

**Class**: This represents a character's abilities, race, or combat potential.

**Attack**: An action intending to cause damage, harm or other hurtful effect to a target using a weapon or Technique. The exact rules vary from attack to attack.

**Technique**: Abilities a character might posses such as magic or martial arts maneuvers. Similar to "special moves" in fighting games or "abilities" in computer RPGs.

**Session**: A single play of the game.

**Scenario**: This is the adventure or storyline that sets the stage for gameplay, providing a framework for the game, including setting, non-player characters, and challenges, with a goal or objective for the players to achieve.
