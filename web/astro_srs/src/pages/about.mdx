# What is SRS?

SRS, or Standard Roleplaying System, is a universal (but not generic) tabletop RPG system. It was created to serve three needs. Firstly, it is a fast-playing rules-light system which encourages creativity and leaves the focus of the game on the story rather than the mechanics. Secondly, it is an aid for those who wish to concentrate on the content of the game (the setting and story) and not worry about creating a new system or adapting a difficult system. Lastly, it creates an environment whereby content can be shared while maintaining compatibility.

SRS grew out of the FarEast Amusement Research game Alshard and is used in many products, both by FEAR and other companies. Currently, it is one of the most played RPGs in Japan, alongside fellow Japanese RPGs Sword World and Arianrhod and foreign import Dungeons and Dragons.

SRS Basic is a summary of the base rules used in SRS. It does not include details of individual Techniques, Classes, or settings.

# About this Document

This document is a translation of the SRS Basic rules document provided by FarEast Entertainment Research, with some supplemental material. The original Japanese text may be downloaded from FEAR's SRS website (http://www.fear.co.jp/srs/index.htm). The sections from "Rules Glossary" until the end of this document appear in the original Japanese text and are explained here to the best of my ability, with some changes from the original for additional clarity.

SRS Basic is a rules "skeleton" which only provides the basic features required to remain compatible with other SRS titles. Designers are meant to flesh out the skeleton with additional rules as necessary, and especially to fill in such things as the Techniques and Classes, before the game is complete. This means, among other things, that there is no list of Classes in this document; if you wish to play SRS without owning an official rulebook, you'll need to either make your own Classes or use the Quickstart rules with pregenerated characters.

About the SRS Content License
This section is an English-language summary of the Terms of Use document governing SRS. The original Japanese text may be found at FEAR's SRS website (http://www.fear.co.jp/srs/tou.htm). This section is not a substitute for legal advice nor a replacement for the original document; it is merely provided here as a service for English-speaking fans wishing to stay within the bounds of the license.

# SRS is available for both commercial and non-commercial use.

All commercial uses must be approved by FarEast Amusement Research. Generally, a commercial use involves paying for the specific product that uses SRS, such as a book with an ISBN, a PDF distributed for money, or a website with a subscription or access fee. Publishing an SRS product on a commercial website does not necessarily constitute commercial use if the particular product is offered free of charge. Depending on the situation, there may or may not be a licensing fee for commercial use. If you aren't sure whether your use is commercial or non-commercial or you wish to pursue a commercial license, contact FEAR for more information; the contact address and required information are outlined in the original (Japanese) Terms of Use document.

Non-commercial use does not require any licensing fee or approval from FarEast Amusement Research, but individual SRS products are still protected by copyright law and may not be reproduced without permission. The SRS Basic document was created in order to be a free, non-commercial reference for using SRS in non-commercial products. All uses of SRS Basic must be accompanied by the "SRS Statement of Purpose and Terms of Use" and the version number of SRS Basic used. The Japanese text of this notice can be found at the end of the original SRS Basic document. An English translation is included at the end of this document. If the derivative product in question references SRS indirectly (that is, without quoting it or reproducing its contents) there are no additional restrictions; if the product includes part or all of the SRS Basic document, the following conditions apply.

Sections of the text in blue text indicate additional information or comments and may be freely altered. Conversely, sections not so marked constitute base rules and should not be altered lightly; alteration of these rules is likely to break compatibility with other SRS products or otherwise cause confusion. If such a section must be altered, it is permitted so long as a comment is placed before the alteration explicitly pointing out the change. Changing the order in which rules or sections are presented is freely permitted.

For further information, please consult the original (Japanese) Terms of Use document. Please do not contact FarEast Amusement Research without reading and understanding that document.
