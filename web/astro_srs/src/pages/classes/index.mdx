## Classes in Construction

You'll need to especially pay attention to the following sections when using the Construction method, but Quickstart characters don't need to worry about them.

### Base Attribute Values

The Base Attribute points you gain for choosing this Class as one of your initial 3 are written here.

### Combat Value Bonuses

A chart detailing how the Combat Values change depending on the Level of the Class. The horizontal axis indicates the level and the vertical indicates the value to adjust. The bonus is not cumulative; only add the value for the current Level achieved.

### Technique Progression

The Techniques a character of this Class knows automatically (at Level 1) and have the possibility to learn upon increase in Level are listed here. The "Initial Techniques" section details the automatic Level 1 Techniques, and the "Level Up" section details the Techniques that can be learned with an increase in Level.
