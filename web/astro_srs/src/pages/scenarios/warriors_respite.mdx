# Warrior's Respite

In this Scenario, the players must grant a loving daughter's wish to save her father from the nefarious schemes of the _Moon Witch_. The GM should carefully read the Scenario to get a firm grasp of the contents before the session.

# Pre-play

## Scenario Information

- **Number of players**: 3 to 5 Players plus GM
- **Character level**: 3
- **Playtime**: One session, 3 to 4 hours

## Scenario Background

In a small town in the northern reaches of the Reich, the soldier Brutus Ente liveked a simple but happy living with his wife and his daughter Lily. However, one day his wife fell ill and died, and their simple but happy life crumbled.

Not wishing his daughter to grow up impoverished in any way, Brutus arranged for her to attend a very prestigious school. However, to afford the tuition, he was forced to enlist in the Experimental Soldier Corps. By enduring various horrific experiments and bodily modifications, he was able to give his daughter the high lifestyle he desired for her, but after the Reich's quest for the perfect weapon resulted in an experiment to implant their soldiers with large Reactors (crystals which focus Mana and power Kabbalah), Brutus began to develop the symptoms of [Over-Surgery Psychosis](#sidebar-over-surgery-psychosis).

All is proceeding according to the plans of Genardi, the _Moon Witch_, a Disciple of the Abyss. Due to the effects of [Over-Surgery Psychosis](#sidebar-over-surgery-psychosis), Brutus will rampage and attack innocent people.

Brutus knows he is losing his humanity. He wishes to see his daughter one last time before completely losing himself, and so is following Genardi's guidance in escaping the facility.

In this Scenario, the PCs work to stop Brutus's rampage and halt Genardi's scheme.

### Note:

Before play begins, the GM should read the Prologue section aloud to help establish the mood of the Scenario.

# Prologue

One man, for his daughter's sake, sacrificed himself for the Reich... With no regrets, he allowed his very body to be mutilated and transformed, solely for his daughter's happiness.

However, a witch wants to twist that pure intention to demonstrate the power of the Abyss. She paints his heart with darkness, leading him to commit a meaningless slaughter.

Responding to the feelings of a lone girl who has discovered the dark transformation undergone by her father, the Adventurers stand up to save him from the Abyss!

Alshard Fortissimo: Warrior's Respite. Now, you will become legend...

# Characters

After reading the Prologue, the GM should distribute the character handouts (found at the end of this document) and assist the Players in creating Characters for the Scenario.

## Quickstart

If the players are new to Alshard or don't have a copy of the rulebook, you should choose Quickstart to create characters. We recommend using the following five Sample Characters.

1. The Wizard (ALF p.36)
1. The Panzer Knight (ALF p.46)
1. The Vagrant (ALF p. 38)
1. The Secret Agent (ALF p. 44)
1. The Valkyrie (ALF p. 42)

## Construction

If the players are familiar with the rules and own one or more core rulebooks between them, you may wish to use Construction. PC #2 must have a Level of Panzer Knight and PC #4 must have a Level of Secret Agent, and the group should have a representative of each of the four Main Classes (Fighter, Scout, Black Magician, and White Mage), but there are otherwise no restrictions on characters.

## Bonds between PCs

After character creation, each player should introduce his or her character to the group. At this point you should brainstorm connections between the PCs to use as Bonds. Bonds should be formed between PCs with sequential numbers (ie, PC #1 should have a Bond with PC #2, who has a Bond with PC #3, etc., and finally PC #5 has a Bond with PC #1 to complete the circle).

## Sidebar: About PC #2

In this Scenario, it's established that PC #2 is a member of the Silber Kreuz (a military police unit under direct supervision of the Emperor). Before the players choose a handout, make sure to inform them of this.

# Act I: Exposition

## Scene I: The Visit

**Protagonist**: PC #3

### Summary

PC #3 visits Lily Ente and hears her request. No other PCs may enter.

Lily once helped PC #3 out when PC #3 was traveling the Reich. Now she works at a medical research facility in Bartholomäus\*. Once PC #3 gets in touch with her, Lily is delighted at the visit. She also confesses she has a request. Once PC #3 accepts the request, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

You have a friend named Lily Ente. Her mother passed away when she was very young, and ever since then she's lived alone in the High-Class Citizen Block of St. Bartholomäus on the money her father sends. Since you happened to be in St. Bartholomäus, you decided to get in touch with her, and made your way to a public communications terminal. You dropped in a coin and waited as the summons rang and rang and rang.. eventually, Lily picked up at the other end.

"Oh, PC#3. It's been a while, hasn't it? What brings you here?"

After the pleasant surprise of your visit, it becomes clear that Lily is worried about something. She eventually asks for your help.

### Notable Dialogue: Lily Ente

- "I know it's a little sudden, but I'd like to ask you a favor."
- "I need you to save my father."
- "It's not safe to talk about it over the phone. I know a nice restaurant in the High-Class Block..."
- "Oh, you will? Thank you!"

### Conclusion

After hanging up and heading to the High-Class Block, PC #3 gains the Quest "Help Lily" and the Scene comes to an end.

### Sidebar: St. Bartholomäus City

This city houses the Headquarters for the Western Division of the Imperial Army. It is a Sealed City (a large arcology-style city; see ALF p.156). The High-Class Citizen Block is a gated community that exists in the upper levels of the city.

## Scene II: Settling the Past

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary 1

PC #1 thinks back to when his/her hometown was destroyed at the hands of Brutus Ente. No other PCs may enter.

Once you get a taste of the slaughter and senselessness of it all, the flashback ends.

Proceed to part 2.

### Set-up 1

A single Reich soldier destroyed your entire hometown. You tried to help, but you didn't have the strength and soon collapsed yourself. Just then, you heard it – a horrible yell that wasn't quite human.. and your eyes followed the sound to the soldier himself. And then you lost consciousness...

### Notable Dialogue: Villagers

"Help! Help me!"
"Mommy.. Daddy..."

### Summary 2

Hans Wilmer\* gives PC #1 a mission. PC #1 is to extract Brutus from Reich territory. If capture is impossible, the PC is to use his/her best judgment.

Hans is aware of PC #1's history with Brutus, and this is why s/he is being entrusted with this task.

### Set-up 2

When you regained consciousness, you found yourself in the care of Primrose, an underground anti-Imperial terrorist organization. Hans Wilmer, an important agent in the Primrose hierarchy, pulled some strings and got you into the Magic Academy, on the condition that after you graduated you would become an acting member of the organization. You are now receiving orders from Hans directly: You are to secure the cooperation of a certain Imperial soldier... the same one who destroyed your home!

### Notable Dialogue: Hans Wilmer

- "The target's name is Brutus Ente. He is a soldier in the Experimental Soldier Corps. If he is willing to join us, all the better."
- "I am aware of your history with Brutus. That's why I thought you'd be perfect for the task."
- "Consider this an opportunity to settle your past. We'll trust you to make the right decision."

### Conclusion

Once PC #1 accepts the mission, s/he gains the Quest "Discover the truth about by homeland's destruction" and the Scene ends.

### Sidebar: PC #1

During the flashback, PC #1 is just a normal person. It's after these events that s/he enrolled in the Academy and learned magic.

### Sidebar: Hans Wilmer

See ALF p.178 for more information.

### Sidebar: Experimental Soldier Corps

Usually called the "Rear Battalion" to hide its purpose from outsiders, this organization researches new weapons and methods of fighting for the Imperial Army. Recruitment is by invitation only, and is strictly voluntary. Recruits are isolated from other troops and only allowed to meet with friends or family outside the organization once a month, under heavy supervision. These measures help maintain the secrecy of the organization's projects.

## Scene III: Encroaching Shadows

### Master Scene

### Summary

The _Moon Witch_ Genardi\* releases Brutus from his confinement in the Reich's Experimental Facility. This is a Master Scene, so no PCs may enter.

After the conversation, Genardi unlocks the room and releases Brutus. She hopes that the Imperial Troop which will pursue the Experimentally Modified Brutus will trigger his psychosis and cause him to rampage. Failing that, she plans to kill Lily while he watches, condemning his soul to the Abyss. After the conversation ends, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Many stories above ground level in the Sealed City of St. Batholomäus, in a forgotten corner of the Military Block, lies the Experimental Facility, headquarters of the Experimental Soldier Corps. Every night, the researchers in the Facility return to their homes, and the Facility runs automatic maintenance powered by Kabbalah. However, on this night, the shadowy corridoors are inhabited by a woman in a dark, flowing robe–the Moon Witch, Genardi. She approaches a certain laboratory, and smirks to herself as she sees a bound man through the window. Then she begins to speak.

### Notable Dialogue: Brutus and Genardi's conversation

- "Good evening, Mr. Ente. How would you like to walk free again?"
- "Who are you..?"
- "There's no need for you to know that. If you say you want to leave, I'll let you out."
- (He thinks for a moment.) "...yes. I want to leave. The only desire I possess is to see my daughter."
- (She smiles.)
- "Very well. Go forth and greet your daughter with what little heart you still possess. I'll take care of everything else."
- "Thank you. Please do."

### Conclusion

Genardi waves her hand and the door swings open with a loud 'bang'. Brutus, heavily modified, steps out into the corridor.
He looks over to his benefactor, but Genardi vanishes into the shadows. Her smile is the last he sees of her.
'The seed has been planted. Now to prepare the fertilizer...'
The Experimental Facility's emergency alarm system begins its loud cry, and the scene comes to an end.

### Sidebar: "Moon Witch" Genardi

See ALF p.181 for more information.

## Scene IV: Premonitions

**Protagonist**: PC #2

### Summary

In this scene, PC #2 is informed of the rumor that Brutus Ente has gone AWOL. No other PCs may enter.

This is a briefing by PC #2's commanding officer. PC #2's unit is being deployed to recover Brutus. After the briefing, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

The Sealed City of St. Batholomäus, Military Block, Silber Kreuz Special Barracks.

You wake up in your room after a rather disturbing dream. You dreamt that you were dying, and one by one memories of you and Brutus would arise and then slip away.

The reason for your awakening is the Emergency Orders alarm, which directs you to the Briefing Room ASAP.

### Notable Dialogue: Commander

- "An experimental subject has escaped from the army facility."
- "The subject's name is Brutus Ente. It seems his potentials were off the charts."
- "The target is likely suffering from OSP. Exercise caution, but remember to execute your duty without fail! Frieden in der Hand!"

### Conclusion

"Frieden in der Hand!"

The commander gives the order to deploy.

After deployment, PC #2 gains the Quest "Discover the truth behind Brutus's desertion" and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: The Silber Kreuz

The Silber Kreuz is a military police-like organization. PC #2's unit specifically handles matters concerning state secrets and other sensitive tasks.

### Sidebar: Over-Surgery Psychosis

Over-Surgery Psychosis is a rare psychological ailment found among some Soldaten. Almost all Soldaten are implanted with Kabbalah-powered machines which enhance their abilities. However, some react poorly to the procedure and lose the "something" that makes them still human.

Currently, the Reich understands little about the OSP phenomenon, and has suppressed knowledge of its existence among the populace. Among the PCs, only PC #2 knows of OSP; the other PCs have likely never even heard the term.

There are no special rules for handling a character with OSP.

## Scene V: A New Assignment

**Protagonist**: PC #4

### Summary

Patrick Vohn\* issues orders for the capture of Brutus Ente. No other PCs may enter.

Vohn wants Brutus recovered alive, so the experimental Kabbalah technology within him can be properly studied (and stolen). Should capture prove impossible, PC #4 is to provide an extensive report of Brutus's capabilities. Once Vohn ends the transmission, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

The General Materials branch of St. Bartholomäus City.

You've just finished your work for the day, and were relaxing a bit before heading home. Suddenly, your sat-receiver rings–it's a call from Patrick Vohn.
You have a bad feeling about this.

### Notable Dialogue: Patrick Vohn

- "Good evening, PC #4. How's your work progressing?"
- "I knew it'd be no problem for you. By the way, while you're in town, would you mind doing me a small favor?"
- "Oh, it's nothing, really. I wanted you to find someone. He escaped from the Reich's Experimental Facility not long ago."
- "The Reich and Primrose are both already on it, but I have full confidence in you."
- "Thanks for understanding. Good luck."

### Conclusion

As the transmission ends, you receive a message on your computer. Attached is a data file containing the details of your assignment.

After the transmission ends, PC #4 receives the Quest "Report on the capabilities of the experimental technology" and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: Patrick Vohn

See ALF p.176 for more information.

## Scene VI: Shadow of the Witch

**Protagonist**: PC #5

### Summary

Shirley the Blue* orders PC #5* to halt the spread of the Abyss. No other PCs may enter.
Shirley informs PC #5 of Genardi's plan and sends him/her to disrupt it. After Shirley gives the order, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

You are encamped near the shore of a quiet lake. Although the sky is clear, it's a gloomy night, and the moonlight barely penetrates to the ground.

What little moonlight there is glints off the surface of the coin used as the pommel of the sword you now discover currently laying atop your pack. In the reflection, the dim visage of Shirley appears before you.

### Notable Dialogue: Shirley the Blue

- "One has sighted the 'Moon Witch' in St. Bartholomäus."
- "O PC #5. I beseech you, strike with alacrity."
- "May the Shard's guidance watch over you."

### Conclusion

The old monk's words echo in your ears as a cloud passes over the moon; its sustaining light gone, his form shimmers and vanishes.

Once the message has been delivered, PC #5 gains the Quest "Hinder the plans of the Abyss" and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: Shirley the Blue

See ALF p.181 for more information.

### Sidebar: PC #5

The location of this scene could be basically anywhere, but should be relatively near the Western Reich to explain why Shirley decided to contact this person instead of another.

## Lily Ente

Extra

A 20 year-old woman who lives in the High Class Block of St. Bartholomäus. Her mother passed away when she was young, and she's lived on her own with minimal contact with her father for many years, so she's a very strong, independent woman. She's friends with PC #3. Thanks to the allowance her father sends and her good grades, and with the memory of her mother's death from illness fresh in her mind, she has secured a job as a medical researcher at a prestigious research facility.

# Act II: Action

## Scene VII: Pursuit

**Protagonist**: PC #2

### Summary

While searching for Brutus in the High Class Block, PC #2 discovers Genardi. PC #3* may not enter; the difficulty for any other PCs* is 8.

Because this block is highly populated, with many people coming and going, tracking is difficult.

The person ordering the Silber Kreuz is the _Moon Witch Genardi_. Scene crashing PCs may know of Genardi if they wish, but PC #2 does not. She is being guarded by members of the Silber Kreuz, so it's impossible to get close. If questioned by the PCs, Genardi will give evasive answers. Should a battle begin, instead conclude the scene immediately. Otherwise, conclude the scene when the conversation with Genardi becomes uninteresting.

### Set-up

Your unit is following up on a sighting of Brutus Ente in the High Class Block, and is currently investigating. The area is densely popualted; if you don't bring Brutus into custody soon, untold numbers of civilians could be harmed. The searching soldiers are growing anxious and impatient.

While searching the area, you see something very peculiar. A woman you don't recognize, clad in sorcerer robes, is commanding a different unit of Silber Kreuz. When she sees you, a faint smile emerges.

### Notable Dialogue: Genardi

- "Excuse me, but did you want something?"
- "If you have time to stare at me, perhaps you should be searching for Brutus, yes? Those are the Imperial Army's orders for all divisions."

### Conclusion

Suddenly, there is a loud explosion in a nearby park. The PCs rush to investigate, and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: PC #3

PC #3 can't enter this scene because s/he's having lunch with Lily in the next scene. Please announce this to your players when setting the scene.

### Sidebar: Other PCs

PCs other than PC #2 can act openly in the scene if they wish, or remain hidden and observe. The area is crowded, so they can pose as ordinary citizens if they wish. Because finding Brutus is the top priority for the Imperial Troops in the area, they are unlikely to harass other PCs even if they openly act as Adventurers. Feel free to have PC #2's commanding officer call off hostile action if necessary.

## Scene VIII: How I Feel

**Protagonist**: PC #3

### Summary

PC #3 meets with Lily and listens to her story. Anyone who was present last scene cannot enter; for everyone else, the difficulty is 10.

Lily will tell about how her father destroyed a town, and about how she works at a medical research facility, and explain that she believes it was due to [Over-Surgery Psychosis](#sidebar-over-surgery-psychosis). According to her research*, if the victim of [Over-Surgery Psychosis](#sidebar-over-surgery-psychosis) hasn't completely lost sanity, they can be cured with long-term medical treatments and therapy. She wants PC #3 to help her break her father out of the Experimental Facility* so she can begin this process.

If other PCs crash the scene, Lily will be on guard against them, but if they overhear and offer support she will accept. Once her request is given, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

You arrive at the restaurant Lily mentioned, situated in the upper corner of the High Class Block. Even though you arrive early, Lily is already waiting for you, and waves you over to her table. You take your seat, and she begins to speak.

### Notable Dialogue: Lily Ente

- "I've discovered that my father was involved in a great tragedy..."
- "When he was attacking, he howled like a wild animal. That's a symptom of a disease called Over-Surgery Psychosis."
- "I need your help. I want to break him out of the Experimental Facility where he's being held."
- (if you try to recruit her to Primrose) "Right now I just want to help my father. Maybe once he's well..."

### Conclusion

She wholeheartedly requests your cooperation, bowing in front of you. Before you can respond, a huge explosion sounds from outside, and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: Lily's research

As you talk about her father, she gets more and more emotional. It seems she's been researching OSP ever since she heard about the incident with her father. She has had some promising results, but there's no proof of a total cure yet.

### Sidebar: Brutus's escape

When she heard about Brutus's transformation, she tried to get the army to let her see him, but they refused her request. This is because the experimental technology used on Brutus is still top secret. Faced with no other options, she came up with the plan to break him out.

## Scene IX: Rampage

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary

The PCs arrive to find Brutus on a rampage. All PCs are automatically present. Lily stays in the restaurant to avoid danger.

Many Soldaten have entered the park and are setting up a perimeter around Brutus to prevent his escape, but none are approaching closely.

Brutus will not respond to words*. While the Soldaten hesitate, Brutus takes the opportunity to attack* using his Blessings. He uses Freija and Nergal to damage everyone present and attempts to escape. The attacks defeat the Soldaten and even take out a nearby Aircar.

### Set-up

You rush to the scene, but in one of the High Class Block's many parks, a tragedy just like the one you remember is now unfolding. The fountain at the center of the park is completely gone, a crater in its place, and from the destroyed rubble, pipes spray water into the air. Brutus, in the center of the destruction, screams out, and his inhuman voice reverberates on nearby buildings.

In Brutus's eyes\* you find no trace of sanity, and as you approach he turns to you and raises a gigantic saber above his head.

### Notable Dialogue: Brutus

- "GRAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"

### Conclusion

The fountain runs red with blood. The scene around you looks like hell itself. Brutus's mad laughter echoes in your mind as you lose consciousness... (and the scene ends).

### Sidebar: Brutus's response

If PC #2 tries to communicate, Brutus will seem to recognize him/her, cry out as if in pain and shake his head. He doesn't react to anyone else.

### Sidebar: Brutus's attack

If any PCs try to activate Blessings or Techniques to defend against the attacks, suggest to them to save their resources for later scenes. If anyone persists, or naturally survives the attack without being incapacitated, have Brutus use Hermodr to escape the scene. Brutus's combat statistics are included later in this document.

## Scene X: Meeting by Chance

**Protagonist**: PC #3

### Summary 1

Lily hears about Brutus's condition and confirms her [Over-Surgery Psychosis](#sidebar-over-surgery-psychosis) hypothesis. All PCs are automatically present.
Lily comes to the park and asks after Brutus. After the conversation, proceed to part 2.

### Set-up 1

When you regain consciousness, the first thing you see is Lily's worried face. Everything around you has been reduced to rubble, and of all the people who were here before, only the group of you and Lily are still alive. Lily guessed the explosion was her father's doing and finally decided to come in person.

- "Are you alright?"

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- "By the time I'd arrived it was already too late..."
- (when told about Brutus) "It's just like I thought.. my father is a victim of OSP."

### Summary 2

Genardi's voice* is heard giving orders over the radio. Lily decides to escape from St. Bartholomäus with her father, and wants to return to her apartment for luggage*. She asks the PCs to accompany her\*. When they agree, conclude the scene.

### Set-up 2

Your conversation with Lily is interrupted when a Soldat radio from a fallen soldier emits a loud burst of static, then resolves into a woman's voice.

### Notable Dialogue: the voice on the radio

- "The target has routed our negotiations party. Your new orders are to kill on sight."
- "We have received information that the target is searching for a woman named Lily Ente. - Find and detain her immediately."

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- (after hearing the radio) "It looks like to save my father, we'll have to escape from the Reich..."
- "Please. They're trying to capture me. Can you help me get back into my apartment?"

### Conclusion

You pile into Lily's Aircar and begin towards her apartment. Perhaps if Brutus sees Lily, he'll end his rampage. But if anything happens to her, all your efforts will be wasted. Everyone accompanying Lily gains the Quest "Protect Lily", and the scene ends.

### Sidebar: Genardi's voice

When the woman's voice comes over the radio, those who were present at Scene 8 recognize it as the same woman (Genardi). If PC #2 is present, she will announce that the unit s/he belonged to in the Silber Kreuz was entirely destroyed, giving PC #2 ample opportunity to disregard orders if desired.

### Sidebar: Lily's luggage

Most importantly, her research on OSP and its possible treatment methods are there, so she won't leave without getting that information.

### Sidebar: Accompanying Lily

Some PCs may disagree with Lily's decision to escape with her father, and will refuse to help. PCs #1 and #2 especially might have deep resentment towards Brutus thanks to his rampages, and may want to see him dead rather than help. In this case, try the following.

- Immediately play out scene 11 in the park. If they decide to continue as a group, continue as normal (do the conclusions of scenes 10 and 11 back to back), but if the argument between the PCs goes too long, cut it short by saying the two groups separate. Waiting for the two groups to reconcile may take a lot of time away from the rest of the session.
- If the two groups separate, play scenes 12 and 13 with the group that stayed with Lily (choosing a new protagonist if necessary), then have both groups join again when Brutus appears at scene 14. Of course if anyone in the dissenting group wants to crash one of those two scenes, let them (difficulty 10).

## Scene XI: A Daughter's Feelings

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary

Lily talks about her father. All PCs are automatically present.

Lily talks about how her father undertook the experiments in order to give her a good life. It comes up that the town Brutus destroyed was PC #1's hometown, and she apologizes. She tries to secure his/her cooperation in her plan to save Brutus and prevent future tragedies.

While PC #1 and Lily talk, the other PCs discuss the situation and come to a consensus as to what to do. Let the PCs converse freely but if it seems the conversation will go on too long, or if the conversation stops being interesting, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Once everyone is settled in the Aircar, Lily begins driving it towards her home. You're riding shotgun and you watch her as she drives. The things her father did are extremely hard to forgive. But you can see that her desire to save her father from his condition is also genuine. You decide to talk it over with her.

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- "My mom died when I was little. My dad decided to enroll me in a top-class school, and to be able to afford it he volunteered for the Rear Battalion."
- "It was only recently I learned that the allowance\* I got from him was way bigger than the usual."
- "I thought the money might be some kind of reparation for what happened to him\*... but I never got the chance to ask about it directly."
- "I want the chance to atone for my father's sins. Can't you at least help me with that?"
- "He sacrificed his body because of me. I have to help him as much as I can."

### Conclusion

While you're conversing with Lily, you notice that ahead of your Aircar is a barricade set up by Reich troops.. They're questioning everyone about Lily! The scene ends.

### Sidebar: Lily's allowance

PC #2 knows why the amount suddenly increased so much. It was the bonus Brutus got for volunteering to be an experimental technology test subject.

### Sidebar: What happened to Lily's father

Brutus's OSP of course stems from the experimental technology installed in his body. At this point in the story, the characters are still unaware of exactly what technology was installed. (it will be revealed in a future scene).

## Scene XII: Examination

**Protagonist**: PC #2

### Summary

The PCs attempt to break through the checkpoint. Everyone who was with Lily is automatically present.

The Reich army set up this checkpoint to capture Lily. In order to bypass the checkpoint, a representative member of the party will need to beat difficulty 12 on some appropriate action. Use of Hermodr will create an automatic success. On a failure, a battle\* will begin. Once the checkpoint is passed, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Between you and the High-Class Residential Block where Lily resides is a Reich checkpoint. The soldiers see your Aircar approach and surround you for questioning.

### Notable Dialogue: Interrogation officer

- "Halt! State your names and places of residence."
- "We're looking for a woman named Lily Ente."
- (if the PCs try to escape) "Hey! After them!"

### Conclusion

After you escape, a woman clad in black steps out of the shadows near the barricade. "It seems the prey has fallen into my web of her own free will. Now all we need is Brutus.. everything is going according to plan." The scene ends.

### Sidebar: The battle

Use the stats on ALF p.200 for "Soldat Group #1". There are a total of two groups, in a single Engagement 5m from the party. Because this battle is a penalty for failing the roll, don't award experience for defeating the enemies.

## Scene XIII: Tendrils of Darkness

**Protagonist**: PC #5 (or #2)

### Summary

Genardi attacks. Everyone who was with Lily is automatically present.

Genardi announces her objective and commands the Soldaten to attack. The PCs must fight while protecting Lily\*. Use Soldat Group #3 (ALF p.200) and a Soldat Gunner (ALF p.200) in the combat. The PCs and Lily begin all in the same Engagement, with the Soldaten in various Engagements 5m away and the Soldat Gunner in its own Engagement 3m behind the Soldaten. Conclude the scene when the combat ends.

### Set-up

The Sealed City of St. Batholomäus, High Class Residential Block, Lily Ente's residence.

As soon as you park your Aircar, a group of Soldaten come out from hiding and surround your position. Commanding them is a strange woman with shocking blonde hair, who you immediately recognize.

### Notable Dialogue: "Moon Witch" Genardi

- "My name is Genardi. I am a Disciple of the Abyss."
- "I modified the miniaturized Reactor developed by the Reich. Whoever installs it into their body will fall to the Abyss."
- "The project was a great success. The subject into which we planted the Reactor perfomed wonderfully. He submitted to the Abyss and destroyed a small town singlehandedly."
- "Brutus, thanks to the combination of the Reactor's madness and his own grief, will soon become a Warrior of the Abyss."
- (to Lily) "And all that's needed to finish that transformation is your life."
- "So, Questors. Can you stop me in time?"
- (battle begins)

### Conclusion

The Soldaten defeated, Genardi will smile and raise her hand. As if to match her, hundreds of the Abyssal Host rise from the ground.

"Won't you play a little longer? We haven't even served the main course yet!"
The scene ends.

### Sidebar: Protecting Lily

Lily is an Extra, so a single attack will kill her. Please inform the PCs of this fact. Should Lily die during the battle, please modify the remaining scenes appropriately.

## Scene XIV: Fallen One

**Protagonist**: PC #4 (or #1)

### Summary

While the PCs and the Abyssal Host battle, Brutus arrives. All PCs are automatically present.

As Brutus slaughters the Host, he becomes enveloped by the darkness. Once his transformation has been shown, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Because of the sheer number of the Abyssal Host, you are gradually backed into a corner. Suddenly, a group of the Host explodes.

Though the smoke of the explosion, you hear a beastly roar; then the smoke clears and you see Brutus. He is dancing among them, destroying them left and right, but you notice he now attacks barehanded, by clawing and biting, as if he has become a mere animal. Beneath his torn uniform you catch glimpses of the reactor embedded in his chest; it seems to radiate darkness.

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- (upon seeing Brutus's condition) "Dad! Please, stop! Come back to your senses!"

### Notable Dialogue: Genardi

- "So you've arrived, Brutus. Good! Kill them all! Follow your black heart!"

### Conclusion

Brutus destroys all of the Host, then, shaking violently, loses his balance and collapses. The scene ends.

## Scene XV: Father and Daughter

**Protagonist**: PC #3

### Summary

Genardi attacks Lily\*, and Brutus goes berserk. All PCs are automatically present.

Genardi uses "Heimdall" to fire at Lily. To stop it, the PCs can use "Hermodr" plus "Cover" to intercept the shot, "Odin" to cancel "Heimdall", or "Idunn" to heal Lily\*. Once Brutus begins his rampage, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Lily rushes over to where Brutus has fallen, and grabs his metal cyborg arm.

- "Dad! Dad!!"

Hearing his daughter's voice, Brutus will open his eyes weakly, and faintly smile.

- "Li...ly....."

In the background, Genardi calmly loads a rifle.

### Notable Dialogue: Genardi

- "I'm not finished just yet." (she fires the gun)
- "Now, fall into the Abyss!"

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- (after being shot) "Aaah... father....."

### Conclusion

Hearing his daughter's cry, a great change comes over Brutus's body.

- "Lily! Grrrruuuuuhhhhh...!"

The scene ends, and the Climax begins.

### Sidebar: Lily

If Lily died in scene 13, skip this scene. Instead, have Brutus see her dead body after defeating the Abyssal Host, and transform at that point, then proceed to the Climax.

### Sidebar: Idunn

If the PCs save Lily without using "Idunn", have her cry out in fear, and have this cry trigger Brutus's transformation.

# Act III: Climax

## Scene XVI: The Disciple of Grief

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary

The battle with the rampaging Brutus. All PCs are automatically present.

The PCs are 5m from Brutus. The "Witch's Orbs" that Genardi summons are in Brutus's Engagement. She summons one per PC.

Genardi will escape prior to the battle; the PCs should not chase after her. Lily will not participate in the battle; what little remains of Brutus's humanity refuses to attack her. Once Brutus has been defeated\*, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

While he emits a mad roar, Brutus's chest bulges, as if his heart had burst in his grief. The Reactor in his chest reveals its true form, that of a Shard died deepest black.

- "W, what...! Is this... the Abyss!!?!?!! LILY!!!!!!!"

Although Brutus cries out in agony, the Reactor ruthlessly strips his body of Mana and replaces it with the dark energy of the Abyss. Brutus's giant, muscular body succumbs to the darkness.

### Notable Dialogue: Brutus

- "Uuuuuooooogh! My body!!!"
- (after succumbing to the Abyss) "You pitiful fools! Fall into deepest grief, as I have!!"

### Notable Dialogue: Genardi

- (watching Brutus's transformation) "Grieve! Mourn! That is the path to the Abyss! Lead all to death! Lead all to the Abyss! You cannot escape your fate!!"
- "Witness the birth of another of our member!"
- "Here is my welcoming gift to you. Battle to your heart's content!" (she summons the "Witch's Orbs")
- "Test for yourselves the might of a Warrior of the Abyss!" (she vanishes into the shadows)

### Conclusion

After the PCs defeat Brutus, the Reactor shatters, and black energy sprays forth, mixed with fresh blood. Brutus's body returns to its normal size, and he collapses in a pool of his own blood... The scene ends.

### Sidebar: Defeating Brutus

Should the PCs be defeated by Brutus, the GM should narrate an appropriate ending. Try one of the following:

- **Bad End**
  The PCs are annihilated by Brutus. Brutus baptizes himself in Lily's blood, becoming a true Warrior of the Abyss, then begins destroying the Sealed City. Before long, the newest Warrior of the Abyss has converted the city into an Abyss itself.
- **Retreat and regroup**
  The PCs escape with Lily, and attempt to evacuate the city before Brutus can destroy it. Once the party leaves the city, end the scenario. The GM and players should decide whether to end play, continue play from here in an original scenario, or continue on the path of a different scenario.
- **Lily's sacrifice**
  Lily tries one last time to get Brutus to stop, and calls out to him. He hesitates for a moment, and the two embrace. Then Lily activates a hidden explosive device and the two die together as father and child.

# Act IV: Dénouement

## Scene XVII: Warrior's Respite

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary

After the battle, Brutus returns to normal and converses with the party. All PCs are automatically present.

Brutus, at the brink of death, attempts to stand; he remembers the destruction of PC #1's hometown and apologizes. If "Idunn" is used to heal Brutus, the scene will still play out similarly; although his body will recover, it will reject the Abyssal energy, which will cause the Reactor embedded in his chest to malfunction, paralyzing him. Once the PCs decide how to handle Brutus, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

Brutus's face seems oddly peaceful. With the last of his strength, he speaks.

- "At last, I can finally rest..."

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- "Dad!!"
- "I still haven't repaid you for everything yet..."
- Notable Dialogue: Brutus
- "Sorry, Lily... Live strong for your mother and me...."
- "I'm so sorry.. for all the trouble I've caused...."

### Conclusion: If Brutus dies

In the end, the dark energy of the Abyss consumes Brutus's body from the inside out and he melts away into ash. The warrior who has fought a long, grueling battle has finally earned his respite. The scene ends.

### Conclusion: If "Idunn" is used to heal Brutus

Brutus, near dead, stirs slightly and opens his eyes once more. He sees Lily watching over him and faintly smiles. Lily returns the smile, eyes brimming with tears. The scene ends.

## Scene XVIII: Setting Off

**Protagonist**: PC #3

### Summary

Lily thanks PC #3 for helping. No other PCs may enter.

If Brutus has died, the two meet at Brutus's grave. Lily was very upset at Brutus's dead, but now she exhibits a strong, confident air, and wholeheartedly thanks PC #3 for seeing this through to the end.

If Brutus is still alive, the both of them will see PC #3 off. They seem very happy together.

After the conversation becomes uninteresting, conclude the scene.

### Set-up: If Brutus is dead

In front of her father's gravestone, Lily bows to you and speaks.
"Thank you very much. With your help I was able to discover what was really going on. Although it turned out like this, I'm sure my father is grateful too."

### Set-up: If Brutus is alive

With your help, Brutus was able to make a partial recovery, and once he is well enough, he and Lily see you off. Their happy smiles are forever burned into your memory.

### Notable Dialogue: Lily

- (if Brutus is dead) "I want to live strong, like my father wanted."
- (if Brutus is alive) "Thanks to you, we can now live as father and daughter."

### Conclusion: If Brutus is dead

Lily decides to lend her support to Primrose. Although she has now been separated from her family, her memories of them give her strong support in her fight against the Reich. The scene ends.

### Conclusion: If Brutus is alive

The two inform you that they plan to return to their homeland and live quietly. They wish you luck in your journey. The scene ends.

## Scene XIX: Mission Complete

**Protagonist**: PC #4

### Summary

Mr. Vohn rewards PC #4 for a job well done. No other PCs may enter.

While you submit your report, Mr. Vohn thanks you. Even though you weren't able to recover the technology installed in Brutus, Mr. Vohn doesn't seem to mind. Once he hears that the technology was far too dangerous to use safely, he decided to write off the entire project.

Once Mr. Vohn has expressed his gratitude, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

You're called into Patrick Vohn's office in the General Materials main building. He smiles welcomingly at you from behind his desk.

### Notable Dialogue

- "Thanks for your hard work."
- "I see, so the reason it was so powerful is because it was drawing energy from the Abyss. That's enough information for now."

### Conclusion

You're just about to leave Mr. Vohn's office after finishing your report when the phone on his desk rings. He motions you to wait, and answers it. After a short conversation, he hangs up and turns to you. "I know you just finished this assignment, but something new has come up. We have another job for you." The scene ends.

## Scene XX: Truth in Darkness

**Protagonist**: PC #2

### Summary

PC #2 is rewarded for his/her role in stopping Brutus. No other PCs may enter.

The official story of the event is that PC #2 singlehandedly defeated Brutus at great personal risk. If Brutus is still alive, this fact will be deleted from the official report by Colonel Wilhelm Gürteler\*, who orders PC #2 to keep that fact under wraps.

### Set-up

For your service to the Reich, Colonel Gürteler awards you a medal of valor. The awards ceremony is attended by all surviving members of the Silber Kreuz. At the ceremony, Colonel Gürteler delivers a speech...

### Notable Dialogue: Colonel Wilhelm Gürteler

- (if informed of Brutus's escape) "The official position is that you neutralized the target."
- (giving a speech in front of the assembled troops) "In the face of a terror attack of unprecedented magnitude, Gefreiter PC #2 showed extreme heroism and valor..."
- "I expect all of you to follow his/her example, and endeavor to act with wisdom and valor. Frieden in der Hand!"

### Conclusion

"Frieden in der Hand!"
While listening to the echoing cheers, you think about what really happened, and about the father and daughter caught in the middle... The scene ends.

### Sidebar: Colonel Wilhelm Gürteler

See ALF p.175 for more information.

## Scene XXI: One who Restores Light

**Protagonist**: PC #5

### Set-up

You hold the coin from the mysterious sword's pommel in your hand. When you expose it to the light of the moon, the figure of Shirley shimmers into view.

### Notable Dialogue: Shirley the Blue

- "Done well, done well. Now the witch's plot hath been halted."
- "Do not mistake this for an end to her evil."
- "You therefore should rest well. A warrior need always battle in moderation."
- "May the Shard's guidance watch over you."

### Conclusion

With the same parting words as always, Shirley's visage once again disappears into the moonlight. The scene ends.

## Scene XXII: The Matter is Settled

**Protagonist**: PC #1

### Summary

Hans hears PC #1's report and thanks him/her. No other PCs may enter.

Hans will smile slightly while listening to the report. Although Brutus wasn't recruited in the end, Hans won't complain about PC #1's decisions. Instead, he is happy he was able to help a fellow member of Primrose.
Once Hans thanks PC #1 for the report, conclude the scene.

### Set-up

You returned to Primrose to report back to Hans Wilmer. While Hans listens to your report, you can see he is quite happy with the result.

### Notable Dialogue: Hans Wilmer

- "Is that so? Thank you for your hard work."
- "You weren't able to turn Brutus into an ally, but that doesn't matter. That wasn't actually what was important about this mission."

### Conclusion

"Someday soon we'll need your help on another matter. I hope we can work together on that day."

As he says those words to you, you can already see the wheels turning behind his eyes as he thinks up Primrose's next move. The scene ends.

Description
Brutus is a Gefreiter in the Infantry Division of the New Reich Army. He is 40 years old. Seeing his exceptional physical and mental strength, the Reich invited him into the Rear Battalion and installed their newest experimental technology in his body. The most impressive piece was the fist-sized Reactor installed in his chest. Thanks to its power, he was able to achieve physical strength far in excess of that of the average Soldat. However, the Reactor was poisoned with Abyssal energy by Genardi, corrupting Brutus into a Disciple of the Abyss.
The former Brutus was an honest, straightforward man who loved his family. He usually speaks politely, but when rampaging he howls like a wild beast.

Battle Plan: Scene XVI
The battle with Brutus comprises Act III: Climax.
For the first round, during the Setup Phase have Brutus activate "Giant Form", then during the Initiative Phase declare "Always First". Use a Minor action to move into the PC's Engagement, then use a Major action to attack with "Reaper". Use "Heimdall" to make the attack roll automatically Critical, then use "Fierce Attack" during the damage step to increase the damage.
During later rounds, use the Minor action "Concentration" to increase Accuracy and continue to attack with "Reaper" and "Fierce Attack". If the PCs retreat from Brutus's Engagement, use a Minor action or "Hermodr" to enter the Engagement with the largest number of targets instead.
Use Blessings to enhance your attacks when able. "Odin" should be reserved to cancel a Blessing that prevents your attack from succeeding.
The Witch's Orbs should attack PCs who are not in Break status in order to apply Pressure.

Reich soldiers under Genardi's command. Even if PC #2 tries to convince them otherwise, they will ignore him/her and attack.
Battle Plan: Scene XIII
The battle to protect Lily from the Soldaten is Scene XIII. Use Soldat group #3 and a Soldat Gunner. Although Genardi is present at the scene, she does not participate in the combat.
The Soldaten will attempt to enter Lily's Engagement. If blocked by PCs, they will attack those PCs. The Soldat Gunner will attack any PCs in the same Engagement as Lily. If Lily is alone in her Engagement, the Gunner will attack her instead.
Because Lily is an Extra, any attack against her will automatically succeed and kill her. Make this clear to players before combat, and announce that the Soldaten are targeting her.

# Scenario Advice from Actual Play

## What's the main theme of this Scenario?

In this scenario, the PCs attempt to fulfill the requests of Lily Ente by putting an end to the dark plans of the "Moon Witch" Genardi, who is trying to turn Lily's father, Brutus, to the Abyss. Brutus is a member of the Reich's Experimental Soldier Corps and has been heavily "modified" by them. Brutus willingly undertook the experiments in order to provide for his daughter, but eventually succumbed to Over-Surgery Psychosis and went berserk. It is important to express that Lily desperately wants to save her father, and he still harbors great love for her even in his deranged state. Please use the dialogue and imagery in this document to help convey this idea.

## Help! My players won't form a party!

The Scenario assumes the PCs will form a party during Scene 9. The PCs from Scene 8 will be interrupted by the sound of an explosion and investigate, and the PCs from Scene 7 who are searching for Brutus will investigate the explosion as well. Should there be any PCs who were in neither Scene 7 nor Scene 8, have them happen to be at the site of Scene 9 when the other two groups arrive.

For example, during one playtest, a PC who hadn't appeared in either scene ended up at Scene 9 by interrogating a deserter from the Reich Army, who tipped him off about the area.

## Help! My players split the party!

If PC #1 gets in touch with Lily and hears her request, s/he may refuse to try to reform Brutus due to the history between them, and may even leave the party. This is most likely to happen in Scene 10 (when the party arrives at Lily's residence). If the party does separate, refer to the sidebar in Scene 10.

For example, during one playtest, PC #1 left the party in Scene 10, but later in Scene 12, the main party failed the investigation check and entered combat.. and along came PC #1 in a vehicle to rescue them! It was pretty dramatic.

## Help! My players want to betray the party!

PC #2 is a member of Wahres Reich's Silber Kreuz unit. Because of this, s/he may want to capture Brutus and return him to the Reich instead of reforming him.

For example, during one playtest, PC #2 was about to betray the party, but we played out a flashback scene to his training days when Brutus showed him the photograph of Lily that he always kept with him; when the flashback ended and he saw that Brutus was still carrying the photo, he decided to help Lily after all.

## Help! My players won't go along with Lily's request!

For the Scenario to complete successfully, each PC should decide to help Lily. You may want to work together with them to come up with stronger individual motivations for helping her.

For example, during one playtest, PC #1 established that the village Brutus destroyed was Brutus's own hometown, so he and Lily were actually childhood friends. Talking to her about the slaughter made for a very intense scene, but due to their prior bonds she was able to convince him to help in the end.

## Help! My players are going to miss the Climax!

In the Climax Phase, Genardi will escape before the main battle begins. Some players may try to chase after her.

For example, during one playtest, we started the combat with Genardi present. As her first action, she tried to teleport away with Hermodr. A PC tried to cancel the teleport using Odin, so we had Brutus use his Odin to cancel the cancel, and Genardi was able to escape (although because of this Brutus was down one Blessing!).
