This is my area for studying rust with LeetCode examples.  
I did start with Easy ones to grasp the basics of the language, in special the syntax and some patterns that I need to use.  
Some of the code does not compile in the platform, I don't f&*Ë†%king care. It runs the test on my machine and I'm happy with it.
