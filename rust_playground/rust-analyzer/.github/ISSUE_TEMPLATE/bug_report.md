Before submitting, please make sure that you're not running into one of these known issues:

 1. local imports (`use` statements) don't work: #1165
 2. local items don't work: #1559
 3. on-the-fly diagnostics are mostly unimplemented (`cargo check` diagnostics will be shown when saving a file)
 4. some settings are required for procedural macro and build script support (`rust-analyzer.cargo.loadOutDirsFromCheck`, `rust-analyzer.procMacro.enable`): #6448
 5. some platform-specific imports are not resolved: #6038
 6. the official `rust-lang.rust` VS Code extension conflicts with `rust-analyzer`: #6463

Otherwise please try to provide information which will help us to fix the issue faster. Minimal reproducible examples with few dependencies are especially lovely <3.
