# Godot Playground!

This is my personal playground with a bunch of code, snippets, small projects and everything that I make with Godot Engine.

### Can I copy any of this?

All the things in this repository is free to use. Most of the code, sprites and everything are free online so you can get a official copy by yourself. (or copy from this repository if you are lazy).

Even the sprites I made you can use in your own projects, doesn't not even need to credit me. I will appreciate, but isn't needed.

### Can I play this games? 

The published version should be somewhere on the [Itch.io](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/), it's easy to find.

Otherwise just open the project in your Godot and play the game.

### Can you tell me something about the projects it self?

Yeah, just PM me on the twitter or mail me at shin.jef@gmail.com.
