# Godot Playground!

This is my personal playground with a bunch of code, snippets, small projects and everything that I make with Godot Engine.

### Can I copy any of this?

All the things in this repository is free to use. Most of the code, sprites and everything are free online so you can get a official copy by yourself. (or copy from this repository if you are lazy).

Even the sprites I made you can use in your own projects, doesn't not even need to credit me. I will appreciate, but isn't needed.

### Can I play this games? 

The published version should be somewhere on the [Itch.io](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/), it's easy to find.

- [Vampire Debt](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/vampire-debt)
- [Witch Call Reborn](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/witch-call-reborn)
- [A Witch Call](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/a-witch-call)
- [Until the end of it(Demo)](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/until-the-end-of-it)
- [UnNamed Caverns](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/unnamed-caverns)
- [Path of Light](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/path-of-light)
- [1Bit Shooter](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/1bit-shooter)
- [Dodge the Creeps](https://shinspiegel.itch.io/dodge-the-creeps-godot-tutorial)

Otherwise just open the project in your Godot and play the game.

### Can you tell me something about the projects itself?
