Each day you will have some time available to interact with friends and play the cardgame to improve your deck.

Possible actions:
- Card game (3)
- Talk with friends (1)
- Move to another room/corridor (1)
- Cutscenes (~unpredictable)

The more you interact with friends the more you you can receive later on, and the more rewards you could get if you have enough interaction with them. You cannot have all the rewards from all the friends. Some special cards can only be received from some friends and some interactions.
