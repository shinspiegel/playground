# King's Journey

## Base Idea

- You need to move the King from the exit of the level.
- The king only moves, and can't jump of do other actions.
- You need to use the Knight, Archer and Shield Bearer.
- Knight can attack with the sword at close (high damage, avg armor).
- Archer can attack at distance (high damage, low armor).
- Shield bearer (low damage, high armor).


## Pitch Elevator

## Story
