#01) NAMING CONVENTIONS ================================================================


You're free to rename the files whatever you want, but this may help you to understand my methodology.
Each bit of information about a sprite sheet is abbreviated, and then separated by an underscore.

Example:
"char_a_p1_1out_pfpn_v01.png" below i will use this example to explain each naming element.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

char
This is a character sheet. All my character sprite sheets will begin with this.

a
Character type A. As of 2020, this is the only one there is, but I'm trying to future-proof my naming conventions.

p1
Page 1. Each page is 512x512 and has a batch of related animations on it.
If you're using the clothes, hair, etc. like a paper doll, you'll need to make sure they all have the same page number.
There are currently 4 pages:
  p1 (walk, run)
  p2 (farming, mining, woodcutting)
  p3 (fishing)
  p4 (miscellaneous)

1out
This 4-digit code references the layer your paper doll part should be set up on.
They should be layered numerically in order to maintain the correct visibility:
  1out (outfit, lowest layer)
  2clo (cloaks, capes, and mantles)
  3fac (face items, like glasses and masks)
  4har (hair)
  5hat (hats and hoods)
  6tla (primary tool layer, weapons and such)
  7tlb (secondary tool layer, shields and off-hand weapons, highest layer)
Note: There are occasions where a big hat or hair might cover the tool layer when the character is facing north.
When this happens, you'll want to move the tool layer down for those particular frames.
Also, some hats will require the hair to be removed to prevent clipping outside the sprite.
I can't forsee how big all my future hats/hairs are going to be, so you'll need to check these on a case by case basis.

pfpn
This 4-digit code references the exact outfit/hair/hat in the sheet. Some examples:
  humn (human)
  boxr (boxers)
  undi (undies)
  pfpn (peasant farmer pants)
  pfbn (peasant farmer bonnet)
  etc.

v01
This is the color palette or variant.
I will try and include a few versions with each asset, but you're welcome (and encouraged) to recolor or tweak any of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some empty folders in this asset, and that's intentional.
Future assets that add outfits, hairstyles, etc. will use the same folders and naming conventions,
allowing you to easily combine them and keep it all organized.

I will also be adding new animations over time, so be aware that most of the currently empty spaces will be used eventually.

Note: There are currently three non-human color variants. These are made to match the colors used in the Goblin and Demon add-ons.
These add-ons are not official Mana Seed products, but they are compatible and I endorse them happily.
You can find any third-party compatible assets in this collection on itchio: https://itch.io/c/1072771/mana-seed-compatible



#02) SETTING UP THE RUN ANIMATION ================================================================

This note refers only to page 1 (char_a_p1...).
The run animation in this asset borrows 4 frames from the walk animation.
Here are some notes to help you make that work:

The first 6 frames (from left to right) on rows 5 through 8 are the walk animation frames.
The 7th and 8th frames on each row are the run frames.
Use the 7th and 8th frames to replace the 3rd and 6th frame to make your run animation.
So the walk cycle would like this: frames 1,2,3,4,5,6.
But the run cycle would look like this: frames 1,2,7,4,5,8

The walk animation can use the same timing on each frame (about 135ms per frame).
But if you use the same timing for the run cycle, it won't look right.
You'll want frames 7 and 8 to hold longer than the others, and frames 2 and 5 to run shorter.
For me, a good timing on the 6-frame run cycle (in milliseconds) is 80/55/125/80/55/125/etc.
But you should experiment with the timing and find something that works well for your game.




#03) ANIMATION TIMING GUIDE ================================================================

You are free to set whatever timing you wish, but these are my personal settings for timing on all the animations (in milliseconds).
Bear in mind, movement animations should be adjusted to match the speed the sprite is moving, which will require some testing.

Walk		135/135/135/135/135/135
Run		80/55/125/80/55/125
Push		300/300
Pull		400/400
Jump		300/150/100/300 (the 4th frame is a repeat of the 1st, and you should hold the 2nd/3rd based on the length of the jump)

Tilling		180/60/60/180
Seeding		300/100/100/100
Watering	400/240/180/300
Pulling up	400/240/180/300

Fishing (cast)	180/100/100/800 (now the line is in the water, hold frame 4 during wait)
Fishing (wait)	400/400 (applies only to the bobber)
Fishing (reel)	400/200 (repeat frames 5 and 6 until reeled in)
Fishing (show)	400/1000 (now you have a fish, return to idle)

Smithing	400/400/80/80/80
Climbing	250/125/125/250 (repeat frames 1-4 until the character reaches the top, and then...) 300 (the 5th frame)
		(note: the climbing animation runs forward-backward 1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,etc. rather than a standard loop)

Toe tap		400/400 (maybe speed up to show greater impatience)



#04) PUSH, PULL, JUMP, CLIMB ================================================================

Push, pull, and jump all share page 1 with the walk/run animation.

Push is a 2-frame looping animation that uses the 2nd and 3rd columns of the first four rows.
Pull is a 2-frame looping animation that uses the 4th and 5th columns of the first four rows.
Both of these animations should loop for as long as the character is pushing or pulling an object.
You can find a timing suggestion in the previous section.

Jump is a 4-frame animation that uses the last three columns of the first four rows.
The first frame is a brief crouch, followed by a rising frame, then an airborne frame.
Then you repeat the crouch frame again briefly when the character hits the ground.
You can find a usable shadow sprite in the accompanying "base effects.png" file.
I put it here so you can manually adjust the height of the jump.
The smaller shadow goes with frame 2 (rising), the larger one goes with frame 3 (airborne).
You can find some timing suggestions in the previous section, but this one will require some testing as you fiddle with height and duration.

Climb can be found on page 4 and occupies the first five frames of the third row, below the smithing animation.
The first four frames should repeat in a forward-backward loop like so: 1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,etc.
Once the character reaches the top of the climb, play the 5th frame briefly before moving to standing at the top.



#05) PAGE 1 ALTERNATES ================================================================

As of update 2.0, two alternates for page 1 are included in the asset.
The polearm alternate (p1po) can be used if you want your character to hold a polearm type weapon in front of them.
The two-handed weapon alternate (p12h) can be used if you want your character to hold a two-handed weapon over their shoulder.

The tool layers (6tla) for these pages need to be switched in front or behind the character based on their facing or animation.
If you can't program this switch into your engine, you'll need to copy/paste them over or under the character sprite manually.
In most cases it should be obvious which way it goes, but if there's any confusion, you can check the included guide image for specifics.
The layer guide demonstrates the 2hwp alt page 1, but the only difference with the pole alt is the tool is behind the sprite for all four standing frames.

There is a "hoe_and_axe.png" image included in the archive that can help you make your own replacement tools.
