# Shinspiegel Playground 

Welcome to my playground, a comprehensive collection of my coding journey. This repository is a mosaic of my progress and explorations on the topics that I've interest, featuring a diverse array of languages and projects, from web API in Golang to game development in Godot.

## Overview

This repository is a living document of my programming journey. From my earliest experiments to current projects, it serves as a testament to my growth and learning. You'll find a mix of small snippets, learning exercises, hobby projects, and more serious endeavors, ususally the serious ones gets a proper repository, and when in development are private, when I think it's in good shape I do make it public.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into languages, runtime or area, like C++, Deno or web.
Inside of it, there is a folder for each idea, snipped or piece of code.

## Contributing

While this is a personal repository, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism that will help me grow as a developer.
Keep in mind that I'll not merge other people's code, this is my playground.

## Guarantee

This is personal code and experiments. NONE OF THIS IS PRODUCTION READY.
