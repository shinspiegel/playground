# Who am I?

Well, that's a tricky question, I'm a design that starts coding and really enjoys doing it. So I made the choice (not too difficult). I just changed my career.

So what is this place?
This is my personal space on dev.to, and I will be posting things I like in the dev world, but there is a problem: I will be posting this in Portuguese, for a simple reason:

_There are many people in Brazil who do not speak English_

That's it, the basic syntax of _Who am I?_
